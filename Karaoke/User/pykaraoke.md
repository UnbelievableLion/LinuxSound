> This is a dedicated Karaoke player written in Python, using a variety of
      libraries such as Pygame and WxPython.  It plays the song
      and shows where in the lyrics you are. A screen dump of [

> PyKaraoke plays the soundtrack and displays the lyrics. It does not act as a
      proper Karaoke system by also playing the singer's input. But PyKaraoke
      uses the PulseAudio system, so you can simultaneously play other programs.
      In particular, you can have PyKaraoke running in one window, while `pa-mic-2-speaker`is running in another. PulseAudio
      will mix the two output streams and play both sources together.
      Of course, there will no scoring possible in such a system without
      extra work.
