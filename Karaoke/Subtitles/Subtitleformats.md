##  Subtitle formats 


We are concerned here with what are called "soft subtitles"
where the subtitles are stored in a separate file to the
video or audio and are combined during rendering.
The Wikipedia page [Subtitle (captioning)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitle_%28captioning%29) is a long article going into many issues about subtitling.
It also contains a list of subtitle formats, but the one
that seems to be of most use in in this context is
SubStation Alpha.
