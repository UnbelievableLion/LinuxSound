##  MPEG 4 files 


> It is becoming common to have Karaoke systems using MPEG 4 video players.
These embed all of the information into a video. There is no scoring
system with players of these files.


> Some rate them as much higher sound quality: ["MIDI files sound so cheesy it's sick"](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=83441) .
I would suggest it is more an issue with the synthesizer used than the
format. Certainly high-end synthesizer manufacturers such as Yamaha would not
agree!


> MPEG 4 files are certainly larger than the corrsponding MIDI files,
and you will need a substantial disk to hold many of them.


> There are many sites selling MP4 songs.
Just do a Google search. However, the average price
per song is about US$3, and if you want to build up a
large collection that can become very expensive.
Some sites will give discounts for larger volume purchases,
but even at US$30 for 100 songs, the expense can be high.


> The cheapest site for _really_ large collections
that I have found so far is [Unify mall](http://www.unifymall.com) There you can purchase (for example) 6,200 English
MP4 songs for US$199. There is a little hiccup in this:
if you buy their "UNIFY PCKP1000A 500-2000GB
HDD MP4/DVD/CDG PC Karaoke Player" for US$559 you should
be able to get these English songs for free! If you want
to also get, say, 25,000 Mandarin songs thrown in for free,
the economics
of building your own Karaoke player become more shaky.
We will ignore that issue here - it's your choice!
