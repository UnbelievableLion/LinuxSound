##  My Android experience 


I have an Android device designed to be hooked up to a TV (or similar) and
used as a media player, browser, etc. It is branded in various ways:
in Australia it was sold by Kogan as the Agora Adroid TV, and is available
in other countries under different names
while the OEM appears to be jointech.com.hk selling it as the JTV220 Android TV.


This device is stuck on Android 2.2 and the OEM has not released any upgrades.
Android 2.2 was not the greatest for media support and will not - for example -
stream Ogg Vorbis audio files from HTTP servers.


I also have an Asus TF101 Transformer running 4.0.3. Media support is much
more advanced.


The list of supported types is [Android Supported Media Formats](http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/media-formats.html) .
