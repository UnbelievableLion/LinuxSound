ALSA is currently the lowest level of the audio stacks for Linux
      that is included in the kernel.
      It supplies device drivers with a standard API to access the different
      sound devices and cards. There are a variety of user level tools
      to access and manipulate the devices, built using this API.

This chapter has looked at the user level tools and at building your 
      own tools using the API. There is a pointer to building device drivers.
