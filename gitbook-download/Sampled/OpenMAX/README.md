OpenMAX and OpenSL are open standards from the Khronos group that are designed
	for low capability devices. Vendors of cards are expected to produce implementations.
	There is little by way of general Linux implementations, but Broadcom have
	implemented one of the specifications (OpenMAX IL), 
	and their chip is used in the Raspberry Pi.
	Other specifications (OpenMAX AL and OpenSL ES) 
	are expected to be implemented in Android devices,
	accessible by the Native Development Kit (NDK).
