##  Introduction 


I have two Karaoke players, a Sonken MD-388 and a Malata MDVD-6619.
      Between the two of them they have all the features I
      think I need from Karaoke players. These are

+ Selecting and playing tunes (of course!)
+ Huge range of both Chinese and English songs -
	  my wife is Chinese and I am English
+ Both Mandarin and Pinyin shown for the Chinese songs
	  so that I can sing along too
+ The notes of the melody displayed along with the
	  notes that the singer is actually singing
+ Scoring system showing different features

The Malata is really good in that it shows the notes of the melody 
      and also shows the notes that you are singing. 
      But it has a pathetic range of English songs and doesn't show
      the Pinyin for the Chinese songs. The Songen has a good selection
      of both and shows the Pinyin, but doesn't show the notes and has
      a simplistic scoring system.


So I want to take the songs off my Sonken DVD and either play them
      on the Malata or on my PC. Playing them on my PC is preferred because
      then I am only limited by the programs that I can write and am not
      so dependent on the vendor's machines. So my immediate goal is to
      get the songs off the Sonken DVD and start playing them in the ways
      that I want.


The files on the Sonken DVD are in DKD format. This is an
      undocumented format probably standing for Digital Karaoke Disk.
      Many people have worked on this format, and there has been 
      much discussion in forums such as the Karaoke Engineering.
      These include [

When I started looking at my disk, I went about it in a different
      direction to many of the posters in these forums. Also, the results
      in the forums were presented in an adhoc and often confusing manner -
      as could be expected. So I ended up re-inventing a lot of what had
      already been discovered, as well as coming up with some new stuff.


In hindsight, I could have saved myself weeks of work if I had paid
      proper attention to what was said in the forums. So this chapter
      is my attempt to lay out the results in a simple and logical enough
      way so that people trying to do similar things with their own disks
      can easily work out what is applicable to their situation and
      what is different.


What this chapter will cover is

+ What files are on my DVD
+ What each file contains (overview)
+ Matching song titles to song numbers
+ Finding the song data on the disk
+ Extracting the song data
+ Decoding the song data

This section is not complete, as there is still more to be
      discovered.
