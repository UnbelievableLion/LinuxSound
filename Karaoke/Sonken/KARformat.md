##  KAR format 


The resultant MIDI files are not in KAR format.
      This means that Karaoke players
      such as pykaraoke may have problems
      playing them. It is not too hard to convert the 
      files to this format: loop through the sequence,
      writing or modifying MIDI events as appropriate.
      The program is not very exciting but is downloadable
      as [ KARConverter ](KARConverter.java) .
