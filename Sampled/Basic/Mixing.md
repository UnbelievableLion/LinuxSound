#  Mixing 

Mixing means taking inputs from one or more sources, possibly doing
      some processing on these input signals and sending them to one or
      more outputs. The origin, of course, is in physical mixers which
      would act on analogue signals. In the digital world the same functions
      would be performed on digital signals.

A simple document describing analogues mixers is
 [
	The Soundcraft Guide to Mixing
      ] (http://www.soundcraft.com/support/gtm_booklet.aspx)
. This covers the functions of

+  Routing inputs to outputs


+  Setting gain and output levels for different input and output signals


+  Applying special effects such as reverb, delay and pitch shifting


+  Mixing input signals to a common output


+  Splitting an input signal into multiple outputs
