##  Where did we start? 


The starting point for all this was

+ I have two Karaoke machines, each with different capabilities
+ I wanted to build a 'best of both worlds' machine from my computer(s)
+ My initial attempt using the Java Sound API worked, but suffered from
latency, enough to make it unusable
+ Atttempts to move any part of this Java solution to low-powered devices
like the Raspberry Pi just failed miserably
