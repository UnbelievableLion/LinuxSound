# Sample format 

The sample format is the other major feature of digitizing
      audio: the number of bits used to discretize the sample.
      For example, telephone signals use 8kHz sampling rate and
      8-bit resolution (see
 [
	How Telephones Work
      ] (http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/telephone3.htm)
) so that a telephone signal can only convey
      2^8 i.e. 256 levels.

Most CDs and computer systems use 16-bit formats.
      (see
 [
	Audacity - Digital Sampling 
      ] (http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/Digital_Audio)
)
      giving a very fine gradation of the signal and allowing
      a range of 96dB.
