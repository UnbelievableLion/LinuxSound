##  Linux 


It is expected that OpenMAX and OpenSL will find their major uses in situations
where the CPU and memory are limited, but where there is the possibility of hardware
acceleration of video and audio by e.g. a GPU.
Consequently, the situation for general Linux systems is poor.
Bellagio has an implementation of OpenMAX IL.
LIM has an implementation of both OpenMAX AL and IL.


I have not been able to find any
OpenSL ES implementations for general Linux.
