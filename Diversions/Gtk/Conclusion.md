#  Conclusion 

Getting to grips with some aspects of the Gtk toolkit is not trivial.
      We will use some of this material in later chapters,
      which is why it has been pulled out of the sound sections
      of this book and placed in a "diversions" section.
      Those not interested in Linux sound may nevertheless find it
      useful.
