#  Raspberry Pi 

The Raspberry Pi
      supports OpenMAX IL from the Broadcom card included.
      If you download the firmware master from the Raspberry Pi 
      download site, a number of examples are included such as
      firmware-master/documentation/ilcomponents/audio_mixer.html.
      These are not "pure" OpenMAX IL: they make use of a Broadcom
      convenience package and also use some vendor extension APIs beyond the
      OpenMAX IL standard.
