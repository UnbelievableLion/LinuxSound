##  Playing MIDI files 


The MIDI files extracted from the disk can be played using
standard MIDI players such as Timidity. The lyrics are included
and the melody line is in MIDI channel one. I've written a batch
of Java programs using Swing and also the Java Sound framework
which can play and do things to MIDI files. At the same time as
playing MIDI files I can also do cool karaoke things like show
the lyrics, show the notes that should be played and show
progress through the lyrics. I'm still working on those, they
will get posted later.
