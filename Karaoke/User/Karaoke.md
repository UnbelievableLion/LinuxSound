      in which the soundtrack and usually the melody are played along

      variations or different features:

	  in sequence


+  The lyrics can be highlighted in synchronisation with the
	  melody line

+  Some players will also include a vocalist singing the song


+  Some players with vocals will turn off the vocals when someone
	  is singing


+  Some players will give a graphical display of the notes of the melody


+  Some players will give a graphical display of the melody and also
	  show the notes the singers are singing


+  Some players will produce scores based on some evaluation of
	  the singer's accuracy. The basis of such scoring is usually not known


+  Some players allow you to change the playback speed and the playback pitch


+  Most players will accept two microphones, and can have reverb effects
	  added to the singer's voices
