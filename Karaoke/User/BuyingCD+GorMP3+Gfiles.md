##  Buying CD+G or MP3+G files 


> There are many sites selling CD+G or MP3+G songs.
Just do a Google search. However, the average price
per song is about US$3, and if you want to build up a
large collection that can become very expensive.
Some sites will give discounts for larger volume purchases,
but even at US$30 for 100 songs, the expense can be high.


> The cheapest site for _really_ large collections
that I have found so far is [Unify mall](http://www.unifymall.com) There you can purchase (for example) 29,000 English
CDG songs for US$399. There is a little hiccup in this:
if you buy their "UNIFY PCKP1000A 500-2000GB
HDD MP4/DVD/CDG PC Karaoke Player" for US$559 you should
be able to get these English songs for free! If you want
to also get, say, 30,000 Mandarin songs thrown in for free,
the economics
of building your own Karaoke player become more shaky...
We will ignore that issue here - it's your choice!
