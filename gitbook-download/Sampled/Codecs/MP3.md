#  MP3 

The MP3 and related formats are covered by a patent. Actually, a whole lot of patents.
      For using an encoder or decoder, users should pay a license fee to an organisation such
      as the Fraunhofer Society. Most casual users neither do this  nor are aware that they
      should, but it is reported by
 [Wikipedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_Society#cite_note-3)
that the society earned â‚¬100,000,000 in revenue for the 
      society in 2005. The Society has at present chosen not to pursue free open source implementations
      of encoders and decoders for royalties.

The codec used by MP3 is the
 [
	MPEG-1 Audio Layer III 
      ] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3)
audio compression format.
      This includes a header component which gives all the additional information
      about the data and the compression algorithm.
      There is no need for a separate container format.
