##  Format shifting 


Isn't it illegal to copy your DVDs? Not in Australia, under
the right conditions
( [Copyright Amendment Act 2006 - FAQs](http://www.ag.gov.au/Copyright/Issuesandreviews/Pages/CopyrightAmendmentAct2006FAQs.aspx) ):


   > Will I be able to copy my music collection onto my iPod?


Yes. You can format-shift music that you own to devices such as
an MP3 player, X-Box 360 or your computer.



I am just copying the music I legally bought with the Sonken
DVD to my computer for personal use. That is within the revised
Australian copyright act. You should check if your country allows
the same rights.


 _Don't ask for any copies of the files off my DVD.
	That would be illegal, and I'm not going to do it._
