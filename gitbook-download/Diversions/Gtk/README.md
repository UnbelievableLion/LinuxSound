This chapter has nothing to do with sound.
	However, many sound applications use a GUI environment
	playing a video (or similar), possibly with text overlays
	such as subtitles.
	This diversion is about programming the video side of this,
	using FFMpeg, Gtk, Cairo and Pango.
	I assume that you are familiar with the concepts of
	widgets, events and event handlers and so on that underlie all
	current GUI frameworks.
