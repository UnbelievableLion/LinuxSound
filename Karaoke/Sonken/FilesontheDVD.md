###   BACK01.MPG 


This is the MP3 file that plays in the background

###  DTSMUS00.DKD - DTSMUS07.DKD 


These are the song files. The number of these depends on how many
songs are on the DVD.

###  DTSMUS10.DKD 


No-one has worked out what this file is for yet.

###  DTSMUS20.DKD 


This file contains the list of song number/song title/artist
as given in the song book. The song number in this file
is one less than the song number in the book.
