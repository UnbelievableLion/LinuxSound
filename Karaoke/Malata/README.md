I have a Malata 6619 Karaoke player.
	It has about 15,000 songs, but only about 500 English
	songs. My wife insists that the Chinese songs on it
	are of far higher quality than on my Sonken.
	I'm not so sure I agree, but anyway
	it's time to try to decode its file format.This is only partially successful: while I have got
	  some information, I can't as yet play a MIDI file
	  from the disk.
