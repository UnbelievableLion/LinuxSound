Shoutcast is a serious piece of server software for internet streaming of audio,
	which has set the standard for streaming.
	Icecast  is the serious open source competitor which is just as good in quality
	and superior as open source. To the receiver of a stream, icecast is just an
	HTTP server. The backend is the interesting part, as Icecast uses the
	shoutcast protocol to receive audio from a variety of sources such as
	online radio, microphones or playlists.
