##  Pulse-code modulation 


Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is the standard form of representing a digitized
      analogue signal.

> Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals.
	  It is the standard form for digital audio in computers and various 
	  Blu-ray, DVD and Compact Disc formats, as well as other uses such 
	  as digital telephone systems. A PCM stream is a digital representation 
	  of an analog signal, in which the magnitude of the analog signal is
	  sampled regularly at uniform intervals, with each sample being 
	  quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps.


> PCM streams have two basic properties that determine their fidelity 
	  to the original analog signal: the sampling rate, which is the number 
	  of times per second that samples are taken; and the bit depth, which 
	  determines the number of possible digital values that each sample can take.




However, even though this is the "standard", there are [
	variations
      ](http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=PCM) .
      The principal one concerns the representation as bytes in a word-based system: [
	little-endian or big-endian
      ](http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/big-endian-and-little-endian) .
      The next variation is [
	signed versus unsigned
      ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness) .


There are a number of other variations which are less important,
      such as whether the digitisation is linear or logarithmic.
      See the [
	Multi-media Wikipedia
      ](http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=PCM) for discussion of these.
