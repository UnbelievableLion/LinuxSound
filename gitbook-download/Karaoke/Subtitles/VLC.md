#  VLC 

According to the
 [
	VLC playback Features - Subtitle/Tag
      ] (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.php?cat=sub)
VLC support under Linux includes the following subtitle formats:

+  DVD


+  Text files (MicroDVD,
	  SubRIP, SubViewer, SSA1-5, SAMI, VPlayer)


+  Closed captions


+  Vobsub


+  Universal Subtitle Format (USF)


+  SVCD / CVD


+  DVB


+  OGM


+  CMML


+  Kate




If you play some sort of video file, say XYZ.mpg, and there
      is also a file with the same root name and appropriate extension
      such as XYZ.ass (extension for SubStation Alpha),
      then VLC will automatically load the subtitles file and play it.
      If the subtitles file has a different name then it can be loaded
      from the VLC menu Video-
>
Subtitles Track. However, this does
      not appear to be as reliable as sharing the name.
