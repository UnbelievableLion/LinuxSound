Java Sound has been around since early days of Java.
It deals with both sampled and MIDI data.
There are many resources available for Java Sound:

including `javax.sound.sampled`.
+ The [Java Tutorials - Trail: Sound](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/index.html) give a good overview of both the sampled and MIDI packages.
+ The [Java Sound Resources: FAQ: Audio Programming](http://www.jsresources.org/faq_audio.html) answers many questions about Java Sound
+ The [Sound Group](http://openjdk.java.net/groups/sound/) is "comprised of those developers designing, implementing and
maintaining the various OpenJDK sound components".
