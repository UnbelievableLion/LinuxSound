##  Sampled audio 


Audio is an analogue phenomenon. Sounds are produced in all sorts
of ways, through voice, instruments and natural events such as trees
falling in forests (whether or not there is anyone to hear).
Sounds received at
a point can be plotted as amplitude against time and can assume
almost any functional state, including discontuous.


The analysis of sound is frequently done by looking at its
spectrum. Mathematically this is achieved by taking the Fourier
transform, but the ear performs almost a similar transform
just by the structure of the ear. "Pure" sounds heard by the ear
correspond to simple sine waves, and harmonics correspond to
sine waves which have a frequency a multiple of the base sine wave.


Analogue signals within a system such as an analogue audio amplifier
are designed to work with these spectral signals. They try to produce
an equal amplification across the audible spectrum.


Computers, and an increasingly large number of electronic devices,
work on digital signals, comprised of bits of ones and zeroes. Bits
are combined into bytes with 256 possible values, or 16 bit words
with 65536 possible values, or even larger combinations such as
32 or 64 bit words.
