Fromlibao Overview"Libao is designed to make it easy to do simple audio output using various audio 
	devices and libraries. For this reason, complex audio control features are 
	missing and will probably never be added. However, if you just want to be 
	able to open whatever audio device is available and play sound, libao should be just fine. "
