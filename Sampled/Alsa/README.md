ALSA is a low-level interface to the sound cards. If you are building your
      own sound server system, or writing device drivers, then you would be 
      interested in ALSA. 
      It sits at the bottom of most of the current Linux systems so to understand
      them you may need to understand aspects of ALSA.
      Otherwise, you are probably not interested so should move on.
