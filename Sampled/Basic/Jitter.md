##  Jitter 


Sampling an analogue signal will be done at regular intervals.
Ideally, playback should use exactly those same intervals.
But, particularly in networked systems, the periods may not
be regular. Any irregularity is known as [jitter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter) .
I don't have a simple way of testing for jitter - I'm still stuck
on latency as my major problem!
