PulseAudio is a sound server, sitting above device drivers
      such as ALSA or OSS. It offers more capablilities than
      device drivers.
      PulseAudio is designed for consumer audio, to make it easy 
      to use sound on desktops, laptops and mobile devices.
      Multiple sources of sound can all play to the PulseAudio
      server and it will mix them together and play them.
      Low latency is not a design goal, so it is unsuitable
      for professional audio.
