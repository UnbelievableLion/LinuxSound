##  HTTP servers 


Content is delivered from a Web site by means of HTTP servers.
      The most well-known of these is Apache, but in the Linux world
      Nginx and Lighttpd are also common. There are a number of 
      proprietary servers as well.


An HTTP server can deliver static files stored on the server,
      or construct content dynamically from e.g. a database connection.
