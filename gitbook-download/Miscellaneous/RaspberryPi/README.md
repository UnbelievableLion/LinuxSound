The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is a low cost Linux computer 
	developed with the intention of improving the background of students entering
	university computer science courses by giving them a good, cheap environment in
	which to play. And its true! I've got a bunch of colleagues at work, well into
	middle-age who have leapt upon it to play with.
	So far their kids haven't had a look-in though...
