There is really only one tool that you need to use with Jack:
 `qjackctl`.
      This gives a graphical view of which Jack applications are playing
      and allows you to link inputs and outputs.

A simple tutorial on using qjackctl is

	HowToQjackCtlConnections
      ] (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToQjackCtlConnections)
It is actually amazingly simple to use: click on a source,
      link it to a destination by clicking on that. A line
      will be shown linking them - and that's all you have
      to do. Many Jack applications will do this for you,
      so you just observe the results.
