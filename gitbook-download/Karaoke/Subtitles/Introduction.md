#  Introduction 

Programs like
 `kmid`and my Java programs
      play lyrics on some sort of canvas object. This gives
      a pretty boring background.
      Video CDs or MPEG 4 files have a nicer background, but
      have the lyrics hard-coded
      onto the background video so there is little chance
      for manipulation of them.
      CD+G files keep the lyrics separate from the video
      but there doesn't seem to be any way of playing them
      directly from Linux. They can be converted to MP3+G
      and these can be played by
 `vlc`:
      load the MP3 file and it will pick up the corresponding
 `.cdg`file.

This chapter considers subtitles that can be created
      independently, combined with video and audio in some
      way and then played. The current situation is not
      completely satisfactory.
