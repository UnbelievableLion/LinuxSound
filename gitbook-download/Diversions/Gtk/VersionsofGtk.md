#  Versions of Gtk  

Gtk currently (at July 2013) has major versions 2 and 3.
      The macro
 `GTK_MAJOR_VERSION`can be used to detect
      version 2 or 3. However, Gtk also depends on a number of other libraries
      and it can  get very confusing working out which documentation pages
      you should be looking at. Here is a list of the
      principal libraries and their primary
      API pages:
