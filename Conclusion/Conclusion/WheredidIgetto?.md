##  Where did I get to? 


Well, I got part way there.
The system ended up consisting of

+ I have three types of Karaoke files
+ MP3+G files
+ KAR format Karaoke files
+ KAR files containing the lyrics with the music in .WMA files
+ All of these files are stored on my (Linux) server
+ For playing the files, I have a CubieBoard2 connected to my
TV/HiFi system
+ I have a variety of devices to control the selection and playing
of files: Linux netbook, Linux laptop, several Android tablets
of different dimensions and even one Windows PC
+ The Linux and Windows boxes use a common Java program. The Android tablets
use...Android




I haven't ended up with a better Karaoke machine. Nevertheless, the system
can play all of the file types, showing the lyrics and playing the music.
It doesn't score, doesn't show a video in the background and doesn't
show the notes that should be sung against the notes actually sung.
Still to come :-(.
