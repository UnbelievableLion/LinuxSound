##  LADISH API 


If an application is Jack session aware, then the LADISH GUI tool `gladish`can manage the applicaiton as a Level 1
application. In other words, `gladish`can manage
Jack session and LADISH clients equally.
In that sense, there is no need to additionally add LADISH
awareness to an application unless you prefer the LADISH
way of managing sessions.
