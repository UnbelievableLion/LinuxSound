##  Conclusion 


All done! Well, as with anything, more can be done.
      But more will, I think, require use of the GPU in these
      small computers. Plus X is giving way to Wayland
      (or Mir on Ubuntu) and that should have hooks into
      the GPUs. So it's off to there I will probably go next.


Regards, and good luck with your own projects!
