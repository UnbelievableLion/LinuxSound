##  Microphone inputs and reverb effects 


> Nearly all PCs and laptops have a soundcard to play audio. While nearly all
of these also have a microphone input, some do not. For example, my Dell laptop
does not; the Raspberry Pi does not; and many Android TV media boxes do not.


> Those computers without microphone inputs often have USB ports. They will usually
accept USB soundcards, and if the USB has a microphone input then that is recognised.


> If you want to support two or more microphones, then you will need the corresponding
number of soundcards, or a mixer device. I have seen the Behringer
MX-400 MicroMix, a  "Four Channel Compact Low Noise Mixer" for US$20,
or you can find circuit diagrams on electronics web sites (Google for
"circuit diagram for audio mixer").


> Reverb is an effect which gives a fuller "body" to the voice by adding
(artificial) echoes with different delays. Behringer also make the
MIX800 MiniMix which can mix two microphones with reverb effects and
also has a passthrough for line input (so you can play the music and control
the microphones). (I have no links to Behringer.).
A similar unit is the UNIFY K9 Reverb Computer Karaoke Mixer.

> DVD players from China often have dual microphone inputs with mix and reverb
capabilities. Given that they can cost as little as US$13 (admittedly for 1,000
units :-), it shows that mixing and reverb should not be too costly.
My guess is that they use something like the [Mitsubishi M65845AFP](http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/MitsubishiElectricCorporation/mXuuvys.pdf) , "DIGITAL ECHO WITH MICROPHONE MIXING CIRCUIT".
The data sheet shows a number of possible configurations, for those who like to
build their own.
