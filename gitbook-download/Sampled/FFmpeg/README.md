FromA FFmpeg Tutorial For Beginners"FFmpeg is a complete, cross platform command line tool capable of recording, 
	converting and streaming digital audio and video in various formats. 
	It can be used to do most of our multimedia tasks quickly and easily say, 
	audio compression, audio/video format conversion, extract images from a video and a lot more."FFmpeg consists of a set of command line tools and a set of libraries that can be used
	especially for transforming audio (and video) files from one format to another.
	It can work on both containers and on codecs. It is not designed for playing
	or recording audio, more for a general-purpose conversion tool.The version of FFmpeg discussed in this book is 
	v0.8 as in the Fedora 16 repositories.
	The lastest version is1.1.3and several things have changed since then.
