##  Players 

###  Mplayer 


I think mplayer is fantastic and probably use it more than any other player.
      I usually run it from the command line but there are GUI versions available.
      It will play almost any media type, video as well as audio. I use it for
      both.


The man page for mplayer is [
	MPlayer
      ](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/man/en/mplayer.1.html) and the reference page is [
	MPlayer - The Movie Player
      ](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/index.html) 

###  VLC 


VLC is my second favourite.


Its main page is [
	VideoLAN
      ](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) and some documentation is at [
	Welcome to VideoLAN's Documentation
      ](http://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Documentation) 

###  Totem 


Very commonly used
