From the [Matroska web site](http://matroska.org/) 


   > Matroska aims to become THE standard of multimedia container formats.
	It was derived from a project called MCF, but differentiates from 
	it significantly because it is based on EBML (Extensible Binary
	Meta Language), a binary derivative of XM.     
	It incorporates features you would expect from a modern container format, like:
> + Fast seeking in the file
> + Chapter entries
> + Full metadata (tags) support
> + Selectable subtitle/audio/video streams
> + Modularly expandable
> + Error resilience (can recover playback even when the stream is damaged)
> + Streamable over the internet and local networks (HTTP, CIFS, FTP, etc)
> + Menus (like DVDs have)



I hadn't come across it until I started looking at subtitles
      which can be (optionally) added to videos, where it seems
      to be one of the major formats.


A GUI tool to create and manage MKV files is mkvmerge,
      in the Ubuntu repositories.
      the command mmg is a GUI version.
      mplayer and vlc will play them happily.
      There is a [
	list
      ](http://matroska.org/technical/specs/codecid/index.html) of recognised formats.
